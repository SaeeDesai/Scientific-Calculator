## Future Enhancements üåü

We have several exciting features planned for future versions of this calculator. Below are some of the ideas:

### 1. Expanded Matrix Support for Larger Matrices
- The current implementation supports only basic 2x2 and 3x3 matrices. Future versions will handle larger matrices and provide operations such as matrix multiplication, inverse, and determinant calculation for any size matrix.

### 2. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- A user-friendly GUI will be developed using frameworks like **Qt** or **Tkinter**, allowing users to interact with the calculator through buttons and text fields, making it more intuitive and accessible.

### 3. Additional Equation Types and Complex Operations
- The calculator will support solving higher-order polynomial equations, systems of nonlinear equations, and other advanced mathematical functions.
- Operations such as **integration**, **differentiation**, and solving **differential equations** are also in the pipeline.

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Future versions will feature better error handling for invalid inputs, edge cases, and division by zero errors, providing users with more helpful error messages and guidance.

### 5. Customization and User Preferences
- Users will be able to customize their experience by selecting preferred settings for mathematical precision, units (degrees/radians), and color themes in the GUI.

### 6. Performance Optimization
- As the complexity of the operations increases, performance optimization will be prioritized to ensure that the calculator remains fast even for larger datasets and calculations.
